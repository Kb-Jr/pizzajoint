# Framer Motion
## Learning Animations on React with Framer Motion

### Setting up
- Add framer-motion to list of dependencies and install with "npm install"
- Import "motion" from 'framer-motion', add 'motion.' to any JSX tag and specify an 'animate' prop to be able to animate this tag/element. 

### Initial state
- We can set the initial state of any element by adding the 'initial' prop to the motion element and adding an object containing a rule or set of rules to define the initial state.
